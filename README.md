# Macros Rule!

Repo for "Macros Rule!", A presentation about macros for Rust Melbourne.
- The code for the slides is located in `/slides`
- The code examples shown throughout are located in `/examples`

## Building

Building the examples requires a rust installation and cargo.
Some of the examples may use nightly-only features so using a nightly install is recommended.

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome :)
