# Macros Rule!

Repo for "Macros Rule!", A presentation about macros for Rust Melbourne.
- The code for the slides is located in `/slides`
- The code examples shown throughout are located in `/examples`

## Building

The examples are setup as a cargo workspace so you can build and test them all using cargo.
Some of the examples may use experimental syntax so using a nightly install of rust is recommended.

```
cd examples
cargo check
cargo test
```

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome :)
